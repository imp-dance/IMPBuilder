# IMPBuilder

## Just another website builder.

Going to make myself a small builder just to setup a basic website file structure, and related web things such as an option to setup a NodeJS app etc. Ideally I'll be able to make the setup process clean and simple and fast, but the result be super convenient and light and easy to delve into.
